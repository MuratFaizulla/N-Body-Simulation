Compiling and executing your program. 
To compile your program from the command line, type the following in your embedded terminal:

> javac-introcs NBody.java

To execute your program from the command line, redirecting from the file planets.txt to standard input, type:
> java-introcs NBody 157788000.0 25000.0 < planets.txt

After the animation stops, your program must output the final state of the universe in the same format as the input.

●	Run your program on another input file, such as kaleidoscope.txt - produces this animation.
java-introcs NBody 157788000.0 25000.0 < kaleidoscope.txt
